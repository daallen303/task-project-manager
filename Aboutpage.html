This is a task and project management application that allows you to organize your assignments in order of urgency and shows your progress to keep you on track of the most important projects in your life. By utilizing three separate categories for your assignments, new task, started, and completed, you&rsquo;ll be able to follow your success from conception to completion.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p><strong>Q.&nbsp;</strong>What is the difference between tasks and projects?</p>
<p><strong>A. </strong>A task is an assignment with only one requirement. Examples of tasks would be: read chapter 14, math homework for section 16.4, or study for economics exam. Each of these are independent of other tasks. Projects, however, are composed of several tasks, and are only considered completed when all the tasks that make up the project are done. For example, say you have a big semester long project. There would be several tasks to complete for the project to be considered done, and these are grouped together in the project folder. Once all tasks in the project are finished, the project itself is completed.</p>
<p><strong>Q. </strong>What do the different colors on my tasks/ projects mean?</p>
<p><strong>A. </strong>Your tasks and projects appear in order or priority, with the highest priority at the top of the list, and the lower priority at the bottom. The colors are another way of displaying the urgency of the assignments. With the darkest blue signifying the highest priority and the lightest blue denoting the lowest priority.</p>
<p><strong>Q. </strong>How do I add tasks to a project after I started working on it?</p>
<p><strong>A.&nbsp;</strong>If a project needs another task after you&rsquo;ve started working on it click the &ldquo;New task&rdquo; button in the task window. From there add the name, description, and priority of the task. You will also be given the option to add the task to an existing project. Click the dropdown menu and locate the name of the project you want to add the task to. Once you have done this click the &ldquo;Save task&rdquo; button, it will now appear under the project selected.</p>
